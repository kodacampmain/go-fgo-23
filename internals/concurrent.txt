concurrency vs parallelism
parallelism
- doing many tasks simultaneously
- happens on at least two processors
- executed simultaneously by leveraging multiple processors or CPU cores
- running at the same time on separate processing units
- scientific computing, data processing, and multimedia applications

concurrency
- handling many tasks together in singular processor
- progress on multiple tasks at the same time, without necessarily running them in true parallel
- switch between tasks so quickly that it appears as if they are running simultaneously
- more efficient resource utilization and responsiveness in applications
- operating system, managing numerous client requests in a server, or 
running multiple threads or goroutines
